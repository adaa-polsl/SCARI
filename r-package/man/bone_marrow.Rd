\title{Medical data of periatric patients}
\format{A data frame with 187 rows and 37 variables}
\description{
The dataset describes pediatric patients with several hematologic diseases: malignant disorders
(i.a. patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, with acute myelogenous leukemia, with chronic myelogenous
leukemia, with myelodysplastic syndrome) and nonmalignant cases (i.a. patients with severe aplastic anemia,
with Fanconi anemia, with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy).
All patients were subject to the unmanipulated allogeneic unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
The motivation of this study was to identify the most important factors influencing the success or failure of the transplantation procedure.
In particular, verification of the research hypothesis that increased dosage of CD34+ cells / kg extends overall survival
time without simultaneous occurrence of undesirable events affecting patients' quality of life.
